GUANO - Grand Unified Acoustic Notation Ontology
This document outlines an extensible metadata format specifically for use with bat acoustic recordings, GUANO, the "Grand Unified Acoustic Notation Ontology".

Project Goals
Among current manufacturers of bat detectors, and even among models of bat detectors from the same manufacturer, there exists wildly incompatible formats for persisting metadata about echolocation recordings. This severely impacts interoperability during post-processing and analysis.

GUANO aims to provide an open and extensible format which any manufacturer of hardware or software may utilize for persisting metadata, such that their metadata may be semantically interpreted.

This specification also describes the a standard for embedding GUANO metadata inside full-spectrum .WAV files as well as zero-cross Anabat files, which cover the majority of bat acoustic recordings in use. Other file formats are also in use, and manufacturers are invited to explore the application of GUANO metadata to those file formats as well.

Status
This format and specification are in the production phase. There currently exist hardware bat detectors which write GUANO-format recordings, and real-world software which reads and writes GUANO metadata.

GUANO is considered at the "Version 1.0" stage, and though no significant backwards incompatible changes will be made to this 1.0 version of the format, slight clarifications and bugfixes may be made to this specification in order to best address vendor and user concerns. The changelog at the end of this document details all changes to the specification going forward.

Note that mention of manufacturers and products within this specification are used for reference or for example, and do not indicate adoption or endorsement of the GUANO format by those manufacturers unless explicitly stated so.

Definitions and Common Data Conventions
All GUANO metadata must be persisted as UTF-8 Unicode string. This is a multi- byte encoding which uses just a single byte for all "ASCII" data, but a variable number of bytes for encoding "special" characters.

That's right, all data must be written as UTF-8 string. GUANO does not allow a binary representation for floating point data (eg. IEEE 754), but rather requires the base10 string literal representation.

Newlines must be specified with the '\n' linefeed (UTF-8 and ASCII 0x0A) character only.

Multiline strings which need to encode a literal newline should write the two-byte string "\n" ("backslash n", UTF-8 and ASCII 0x5C 0x6E). Correspondingly, software which reads fields that support multiline string values should interpret the two-byte string "\n" as a newline. This embedded newline syntax applies exclusively to fields which specify "multiline string" as their data type. In order to keep this escaping rule as simple as possible, this specification does not define a way to include the literal string "\n"; it should always be interpreted as a newline within a multiline string.

Binary field values should be encoded as Base64 strings as defined in RFC 4648. Newlines may not be inserted into the data, and the "Base 64 Alphabet" must be used.

Extra whitespace may be used when formatting field names and values; whitespace should be trimmed upon reading. This gives writing implementations freedom to optionally format the metadata upon writing for clarity or organization. This also allows writing implementations to initialize a fixed-size block containing only whitespace characters (eg. UTF-8 and ASCII space character 0x20) for performance, then write specific metadata values after actual recording data has been streamed to disk. Because .WAV sample data must be aligned to even byte boundaries, implementations should pad the GUANO metadata sub-chunk with whitespace to an even number of bytes.

Reading implementations should ignore all metadata fields which they do not recognize (for example, new fields from later metadata specification versions, or namespaced manufacturer-specific fields). Editing implementations should persist all unknown metadata fields exactly as read.

Dates, times, and datetimes must appear in one of the following formats, which are subsets of the ISO 8601 and RFC 3339 specifications.

Embedding in WAVE Files
The canonical .WAV file consists of a fmt_ sub-chunk, which provides metadata about the recording data itself, and a data sub-chunk, which contains that primary recording data.

GUANO metadata, when embedded in a .WAV file, must be placed into its own sub-chunk with ID guan. Implementations are free to locate the guan sub-chunk anywhere within the RIFF container they wish. Writing implementations may prefer to place this sub-chunk at the end of the .WAV file (so they can efficiently stream recording data to disk with minimal buffering), while reading implementations may wish it were located at the start (so they don't need to read the entire file into memory). This means that all implementations must conform to the RIFF format and jump sub-chunk to sub-chunk if necessary.

Embedding in Anabat Files
GUANO metadata may be embedded in an Anabat-format zero-cross file by writing the UTF-8 encoded metadata after the data information table, but before the start of the interval data. The GUANO metadata should be padded to an even byte length.

The data pointer at file offset 0x11A must point to the start offset of the interval data itself. This pointer is a little-endian 16-bit unsigned integer, therefore the Anabat file format limits the size of GUANO metadata to a maximum of 65199 bytes (0xFFFF - 0x150 bytes for the header itself). Older software may impose a 32kb total file size limit on Anabat files, but as of 2017 Titley Scientific's own hardware and software are capable of reading and writing arbitrarily large files.

Metadata Format
Namespaces are separated from field keys by the first occurrence of the '|' pipe character, UTF-8 and ASCII 0x7C. Namespaces may not include a '|' character (obviously) or a ':' character.

Field keys are separated from field values by the first occurrence of the ':' colon character, UTF-8 and ASCII 0x3A. Keys may not contain a ':' character (obviously). Keys may contain a '|' character so that vendors may namespace their own vendor-specific fields; for example, PET|D500X|TSens: high could be a value which applies to Pettersson's D500X but not to their other products. Field keys are case sensitive, and whitespace within is significant.

Field values consist of everything after the first ':' character, until the next '\n' newline (or EOF), and after having all surrounding whitespace trimmed. Whitespace is not exhaustively defined here, but should include the non-printing ASCII bytes including null, CR, LF, space, tab, etc.

Empty lines are ignored. In fact, the examples in this document use extra empty lines for legibility, though this is absolutely not a requirement for writing implementations.

The GUANO namespace must occur before any others, and the GUANO|Version field must be the first field in a metadata block. This is to ensure that, if future format changes are incompatible, reading implementations may change their behavior for older format versions. Other than the GUANO namespace restriction, namespaces and field keys may occur in any order. However, keys may not be duplicated within a single file!

Extensible Namespaces
Manufacturers are encouraged to include metadata specific to their own hardware or software. The GUANO specification provides a catalog of common fields, but allows for the inclusion of custom fields.

Custom field names must be namespaced with an identifier. Identifiers should be registered in this document so that they are not inadvertently reused, but manufacturers are free to use as many or as few custom fields as they like (it's your namespace!).

Reserved Namespaces
The following namespaces have been reserved or registered. Any manufacturer who utilizes their own custom GUANO fields is encouraged to add their namespace to this list so that it isn't accidentally used by another manufacturer.

GUANO
This reserved namespace is for meta-metadata pertaining specifically to the GUANO metadata in use.

User
Reserved namespace for user-defined fields.

Defined Fields
Writing implementations, whenever possible, are encouraged to utilize fields from the following defined or "well-known" list.

Reading implementations should expect to encounter any of the following fields in a compliant GUANO file.

GUANO|Version
required, string. GUANO metadata version in use. Not only is this field required, but it must be the first field that appears within a GUANO metadata subchunk. Its value is a string, which may be compared lexicographically, and which defines the GUANO specification version that the file conforms to. This specification defines version 1.0.

Filter HP
optional, float. High-pass filter frequency, in kHz.

Filter LP
optional, float. Low-pass filter frequency, in kHz.

Firmware Version
optional, string. Device's firmware version, in manufacturer's own descriptive format.

Hardware Version
optional, string. Device's hardware revision or hardware options, in manufacturer's own descriptive format.

Humidity
optional, float. Relative humidity as a percentage in the range 0.0 - 100.0.

Length
optional, float. Recording length, in seconds. This should be the "actual length", which will be identical to the .WAV length for direct-recorded files, but will be calculated for time-expanded recordings (.WAV length divided by TE factor).

Loc Accuracy
optional, float. Location accuracy, in meters. This should be the Estimated Position Error (EPE); this statistical range states that 68% of measurements will fall within this radius, 95% of measurements will fall within twice this radius. EPE is calculated differently by different GPS receiver manufacturers, therefore it should be stressed that this value is merely an estimate of accuracy. Detector manufacturers may opt to estimate accuracy more coarsely if EPE is not available directly from their GPS receiver, but should express the value in the same one-sigma fashion.

Loc Elevation
optional, float. Elevation / altitude above mean sea level, in meters.

Loc Position
optional, (float float). Location that the recording was made, as a WGS84 latitude longitude tuple.

Make
optional, string. Manufacturer of the recording hardware.

Model
optional, string. Model name or number of the recording hardware.

Note
optional, multiline string. Freeform textual note associated with the recording.

Original Filename
optional, string. The original filename as used by the recording hardware. Editing implementations should persist this value after renaming and/or editing a file as a sort of "paper trail".

Samplerate
optional, integer. Recording samplerate, in Hz. This should be equal to the .WAV samplerate for direct-recording detectors, but should be a product of TE and the .WAV samplerate for time-expansion detectors.

Serial
optional, string. Serial number or unique identifier of the recording hardware.

Species Auto ID
optional, list of strings. Species or guild classifications, as determined by automated classification. This field allows a comma-separated list of values, however some reading implementations may only be able to handle a single species per file; therefore the most "dominant" or "primary" species present in a file, when applicable, should be the first value in this list.

Species Manual ID
optional, list of strings. Species or guild classifications, as determined by a human. This field allows a comma-separated list of values, however some reading implementations may only be able to handle a single species per file; therefore the most "dominant" or "primary" species present in a file, when applicable, should be the first value in this list.

Tags
optional, list of strings. A comma-separated list of arbitrary strings so that end users may easily apply any tags / labels that they see appropriate.

TE
optional, integer. Time-expansion factor. If not specified, then 1 (no time-expansion, aka direct-recording) is assumed.

Temperature Ext
optional, float. External temperature in degrees Celsius. This is the temperature outside the device's housing - the "ambient" temperature.

Temperature Int
optional, float. Internal temperature in degrees Celsius. This is the temperature as measured inside the device's housing, where there is an expectation of some variance from actual "ambient" temperature.

Timestamp
required, datetime. Date and time of the start of the recording, in ISO 8601 compatible format (see datetime specification above). It is very strongly recommended that, if UTC offset is known, it is explicitly specified rather than recording the timestamp only in UTC "zulu" time. This is because local time is overwhelmingly more important when it comes to bat echolocation data than is absolute UTC time; unfortunately GPS receivers provide only UTC time, and the local UTC offset for a location may vary according to political boundaries.

0150 n bytes DATA

One to four bytes of data are used to represent time, in microseconds, between
CONSECUTIVE TRANSITIONS. These data bytes are interpreted according to the
following rules:

If bit7 = 0 ( 0 <= byte <= 7Fh )

only one byte is used. The remaining 7 bits form a signed, twos complement number (between -64 and 63) which is added to the value of the previous time interval to derive the value of the current time interval.

if bit 7 = 1, bit 6 = 0, bit 5 = 0 ( 80h <= byte <= 9Fh)

next time interval is contained in 13 bits, upper 5 from the remainder of this byte, lower 8 bits from the next byte.

if bit 7 = 1, bit 6 = 0, bit 5 = 1 (A0h <= byte <= BFh)

next tme interval is contained in 21 bits, upper 5 from the remainder of this byte, next 8 from the next byte and the lower 8 from the byte after that.

if bit 7 = 1, bit 6 = 1 bit 5 = 0(C0h <= byte <= DFh)

next time interval is contained in 29 bits, the upper 5 from the remainder of this byte, the next 8 from the following byte etc. Note that in this case, bits 0-4 of this byte will all be 0 in a file with a maximum duration of 15 seconds.

if bit 7 = 1, bit 6 = 1 bit 5 = 1 (E0h <= byte <= FFh)

lower 5 bits represent a status value which is set for the number of points contained in the next byte. At this stage (June 99) only 4 status values are defined:

0 - point is out of range
1 - point is turned off
2 - point is normal dot
3 - point is maindot

so bits 2 to 4 are all zero and in practice, only values of E1h or E3h will be used. So if this and the next byte were E1h and 5, that would turn off the five next data points. The points E3h and 7 would make the next 7 data points maindots.

examples:

0 same as previous
5 previous + 5
63 (3Fh) previous + 63
118 (76h) previous - 10
64 (40h) previous - 64
128,27 (80h,1Bh) 27 (1Bh)
131,43 (83h,2Bh) 811 (32Bh)
159,255 (9Fh,FFh) 8191 (1FFFh)
160,0,33 (A0h,0,21h) 33 (21h)
191,255,255 (BFh,FFh,FFh) 2097151 (1FFFFFh)
192,255,255,255 (C0h,FFh,FFh,FFh) 16777215 (FFFFFFFh)
225,1 (E1h,1) turn off next data point
225,255 (E1h,FFh) turnoff next 255 points
227,3 (E3h,3) next 3 points are maindots
227,255 (E3h,FFh) next 255 points are maindots

Explanation of terms used
TEXT HEADERS
Text Headers consist of 275 ASCII bytes ordered into the following fields:

TAPE     8 bytes
DATE     8 bytes
LOC     40 bytes
SPECIES 50 bytes
SPEC    16 bytes
NOTE    73 bytes
NOTE1   80 bytes
In practice, NOTE1 appears as the second line of NOTE.

DIVRATIO
The division ratio used in the recording. This is the value which the original signal frequency has been divided by before input to the ZCAIM.

SCALE
The vertical (frequency) resolution of the graph in Herz. SCALE is the number of Herz represented by the distance between 2 adjacent lines in the vertical axis.

VRES
This value is used to determine what value of SCALE is to be used. The value (VRES AND 70h)/16 is used to lookup a table which gives SCALE, ie:

(VRES AND 70h)/16      SCALE
        0               10
        1                25
        2                50
        3               100
        4               250
        5               500
        6              1000
        7              2500
The lower nibble of VRES may contain a value which is used to decide which of three possible vertical axes to draw on the graph.

RES1
is the number of counts (derived from ZCAIM) which represent a time interval of 25ms. = 25000 unless recalibration is in effect.

TRANSITION
A change in the input signal from -ve to +ve (positive going) or from +ve to -ve (negative going). The ZCAIM outputs a value which is the time (in us) since the previous transition (of opposite sign). Note that CONSECUTIVE TRANSITIONS have opposite signs, while LIKE TRANSITIONS have the same sign and are separated by a transition of opposite sign. Frequency calculations use the time between LIKE TRANSITIONS.

The term TRANSITION can be used in two different ways. In several places in the Anabat software, the term is used to denote TRANSITIONS in the original bat call, while in the sense used here, in explaining the file formats, it is used to denote a TRANSITION as seen by the ZCAIM. Because of the way an Anabat detector works, each TRANSITION at the output of the detector, and hence the input to the ZCAIM, will have resulted from counting a number of TRANSITIONS in the original sugnal.
