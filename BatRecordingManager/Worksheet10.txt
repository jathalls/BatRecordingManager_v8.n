Worksheet 10

This is the to do and done record for Bat recording Manager 10.x.x.x

Proposal:-
To incorporate the ability to hand AUTO-ID metadata, from whatever source, and store it along side the normal ManualID.  Also
to incorporate information about auto ID's in reports alongside the definitive manualID data.

Additionally to forcibly incorporate a number of standard bat ID Tags in addition to those already in use, in particular 
2/3, 4 and 6 character capitalised Tags - e.g. CP, PIPI, PIPPIP, BLE, PLAU, PLEAUR, GLE,PLAUS,PLEAUS.

The main database structure will be changed by adding fields to the Bat/Segment, Bat/Recording and Bat/RecordingSession tables
to indicate that the link relates to an AutoID and not to a manual or default ID.

1) add new tag definitions to BatReferenceXMLFile.xaml  //done

2)Add fields to reference database // done - reference database is in the source file folder
    
3)Capture database modification strings // copied to notepad++

4)Add code to update any database to new version number, including current version number constant //done
    backup existing database before modification // not possible at this time

5) modify get metadata to extract and separate autoID frommanual ID
    WavFileMetadata already extracts AtoID separately from ManualID
    In generating a comment ManualID is in plain text, AutoID is in brackets with leader Auto= e.g. (Auto=PIPPIP)
    GetDescribed bats can therefore distinguish between auto and manual ID fields
    Should return all bats in the list BUT add a field to Bat to indicate that this bat is AutoID'd
    Modify GetDescribedBats to distinguish between manual and autoid and tag as byAutoID those bats



6) modify DBAccess.getdescribedbats to deal with auto and manual ids // done including batrecording and batsession links

ERRORS:-
null references in new call(); and in references to call when going to vies a bat reference
Comment line gets formatted to e.g. Soprano Pipistrelle,)(Auto=(PIPPYG)

6b) copied backup version of debug database to the main debug database.
    Createda new table 'Metas' which is many:one to recordings.  Each contains a single
    metadata item with a type (guan, wamd) a Label and a Value.
    wamd metadata includes all wamd fields that are stored in WavFileMetaData
    guan data includes those fields and also all other fields using their guano types for the Label.

7) modify reports to incorporate manual and auto-id data
8) modify recordingsdetailcontrol to display manual and autoid data

generated spectrograms using the Spectrogram plug-in and 'decorateBitmap', when set to Full height the text is vertically 
elongated and needs to be reduced, and the grid lines are appearing in white rather than black.
