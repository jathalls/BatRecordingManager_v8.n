Worksheet 10

This is the to do and done record for Bat recording Manager 10.x.x.x

Proposal:-
To incorporate the ability to hand AUTO-ID metadata, from whatever source, and store it along side the normal ManualID.  Also
to incorporate information about auto ID's in reports alongside the definitive manualID data.

Additionally to forcibly incorporate a number of standard bat ID Tags in addition to those already in use, in particular 
2/3, 4 and 6 character capitalised Tags - e.g. CP, PIPI, PIPPIP, BLE, PLAU, PLEAUR, GLE,PLAUS,PLEAUS.

The main database structure will be changed by adding fields to the Bat/Segment, Bat/Recording and Bat/RecordingSession tables
to indicate that the link relates to an AutoID and not to a manual or default ID.

1) add new tag definitions to BatReferenceXMLFile.xaml  //done
2)Add fields to reference database
    
3)Capture database modification strings
4)Add code to update any database to new version number, including current version number constant
    backup existing database before modification
5) modify get metadata to extract and separate autoID frommanual ID
6) modify DBAccess.getdescribedbats to deal with auto and manual ids
7) modify reports to incorporate manual and auto-id data
8) modify recordingsdetailcontrol to display manual and autoid data
