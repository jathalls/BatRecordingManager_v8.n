Worksheet 11

This is the to do and done record for Bat recording Manager 11.x.x.x
Built and edited using Visual Studio 2022 Preview

BUGS:- 

2021 Aug 07 - Import of .wav file collection misinterprets dates and times.  All recording dates for a multi-day sessionare set to the initial day, and start time is the start time for the session not the start time for the recording, and the session duration is not the actual duration but given as 5' rather than a few seconds.  

    Additionally the Recording display includes metadata. Where this metadata does not include dates and times the dates and times are taken from the file creation dates which are wrong due to files having been copied and re-created.

    FIXED

2021 Aug 25 - Minor - session tag recognition is sometimes confused when there is a long name and the date portion gets omitted from the reconstructed tag.  It is easy enough to manually add the date portion and the leadin is correct.  Non-urgent.

BUG:- System.Windows.Data Error: 40 : BindingExpression path error: 'reportDataList' property not found on 'object' ''FrequencyData' (HashCode=52816024)'. BindingExpression:Path=reportDataList; DataItem='FrequencyData' (HashCode=52816024); target element is 'DataGrid' (Name='ReportDataGrid'); target property is 'ItemsSource' (type 'IEnumerable')
