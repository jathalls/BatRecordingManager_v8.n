Dynamic Import Worksheet
Justin A T halls
8 June 2018

This file tracks the development of the Dynamic Import Process introduced in v 7.0

Under the new scheme the user will open a folder (containing .wav files and a header file) and
the program will open succesive .wav files in Audacity, adding the analysis results to the database
when each file is closed.  it should be possible to re-open a partially analysed folder and continue
with the next un-analysed .wav file.

Access is by an Analyse entry in the View menu
	brings up a folder selection dialog
		if folder does not contain .wav files - whinge
		Try to identify the session tag
		Open the header file and establish the session details
		Confirm/edit session details
		Collect list  of .wav files with no matching .txt file
		Open first .wav file in Audacity
		Open Import picture dialog
		wait... (processing any imported pictures as necessary)

		On Click Next File Button...
			if there is no matching .txt file for the analysed file - whinge
			Create a Recording in the session for the new text file
			Save it to the database
			Remove the .wav file from the list
			Open the next .wav file in Audacity...
		After last file...
			close and Update image Import Dialog
